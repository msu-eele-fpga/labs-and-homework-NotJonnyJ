# Homework 10 : RGB LED Controller

## Overview
In this assignment, I created an RGB LED controller using the PWM controller that i made in HW 8.
Controlling an RGB LED is part of the final project. 

Technically HW 10 is incomplete pending my return to bozeman from thanksgiving break.
I will add the photos of the working LED when i can get the correct resistors to protect the LED.
In the mean time this is the place holder for my H@ 10 submission and it will be updated soon.

## Deliverables
Output images of PWM on the RGB LED (upon my return to bozeman i will add these images)
